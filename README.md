# ***🚀 Slow Motion Shooter 🚀***

I’m thrilled (and slightly amused) to share my latest Unreal Engine 5 project, Slow Motion Shooter! Picture this: you’re a lone hero in a chaotic world, armed to the teeth, and facing waves of enemies who clearly didn’t get the memo about personal space. As bullets fly and chaos reigns, you tap into the power of slow motion to outsmart your foes and create some cinematic moments that would make any action movie jealous!

### **🎮 Key Features:**
- **🔥 First-Person Shooting:** Dive into fast-paced combat where time slows down, making dodging bullets feel like a walk in the park—just with more explosions.
- **🌍 Multiple Levels:** Tackle three levels, complete with a start menu, where each level progressively ramps up the challenge (and your adrenaline).
- **🧠 Advanced Enemy AI:** Enemies don’t just stand there; they react dynamically, creating intense and challenging combat situations. It’s like they’re plotting against you!
- **💥 Health and Damage System:** Tactical gameplay with health points for both players and enemies—because who wants an easy victory, right?
- **🎯 Gun Mechanics:** Enjoy intuitive shooting mechanics featuring slow-motion bullet effects and a solid reload system. Nothing beats that feeling of a perfectly timed reload!
- **🔪 Melee Combat:** When your ammo runs out, switch to melee attacks and show those enemies who’s boss!

### **🧠 Key Learnings:**
- **🕹️ Core Gameplay Mechanics:** Developed using Blueprints for character movement and interactions, making everything feel smooth and responsive.
- **🎥 Smooth Animations:** Implemented animations for player and enemy actions—because even the bad guys deserve to look good.
- **🧠 Advanced AI System:** Built using Behavior Trees to give enemies complex behaviors, keeping you on your toes.
- **🔫 Gun-Firing System:** Created a functional shooting system with slow-motion effects and reloading mechanics that would impress any marksman.
- **🏃‍♂️ Advanced Movement Systems:** Added sprint and jump mechanics, letting players dodge and weave like they're in a dance-off with bullets.
- **⏲ Game Clock:** Included a timer to track total completion time—perfect for those speedrun attempts (or just for bragging rights).

This project has been a whirlwind of excitement, challenges, and a ton of learning opportunities. I can’t wait to take these skills into future projects, where I’ll surely find even more ways to blow things up in style! 💥
